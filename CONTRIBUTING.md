I welcome pull requests, but before you submit one, please **create an issue
first** with a good description of the **bug** you found, the **new feature**
you would like or the **documentation improvement** that you think is
necessary.  I may be able to provide a fix, or provide guidance on how to
solve the problem and there is a smaller chance that I will ask for
significant changes to your pull request, or reject it.

**Don't bother** correcting **spelling mistakes**, extra **white space** or
**code indentation**.  I will not accept pull requests that contain trivial
changes, consider creating an issue instead.
